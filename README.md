# MechNow App (Flutter Project)

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for **MechNow**, a Flutter-based application developed as part of an academic / learning project. The application is built using **Flutter and Dart** and demonstrates standard Flutter project structure and concepts.

At the current stage, the repository includes the main entry-point file and a compressed archive of the complete project for submission purposes.

## Current Repository Structure

```
├── lib/
│   └── main.dart        # Application entry point
├── mechnow_app.rar      # Complete Flutter project (temporary)
└── README.md
```

### Important Note

* The file `mechnow_app.rar` contains the **entire Flutter project**, including platform-specific folders and dependencies.
* This archive has been uploaded **temporarily for submission convenience**.
* The repository will be **restructured later** to follow standard GitHub best practices (uploading source folders directly and excluding generated files).

## main.dart

The `main.dart` file is the **entry point of the Flutter application**. It initializes the app and starts the widget tree using the `runApp()` function.

File location:

```
lib/main.dart
```

---

## How to Run the Project (From Archive)

1. Download the file `mechnow_app.rar`
2. Extract the archive to a local directory
3. Open the extracted folder in a Flutter-supported IDE
4. Run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```
5. Launch the application using:

   ```
   flutter run
   ```

## Technologies Used

* Flutter
* Dart
* Material Design

---

## Future Improvements

* Replace the compressed archive with proper Flutter source folders
* Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude generated files
* Improve project modularization and documentation
* Enhance UI and application features
